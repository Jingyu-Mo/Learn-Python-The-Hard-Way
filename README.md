# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way
Dreaming is important, but it isn’t enough to make your wishes come true. In fact, science tells us that fantasizing may undermine a wish because the positive fantasy tricks your mind into thinking that your wish already came true. Here at Character Lab, we like to think of wishes as goals — things that you can work toward and achieve. 
Dr. Gabriele Oettingen developed a powerful method called WOOP that has been proven to help people accomplish their goals. So I will use the WOOP process to accomplish my goal of learning Python.

## The WOOP Process
**Wish （目标）:**
A meaningful, challenging, and feasible goal
**Outcome （结果）:**
The best result or feeling from accomplishing your wish
**Obstacle （阻碍）:**
Something inside you that prevents you from accomplishing your wish
**Plan （计划）:**
If [obstacle], then I will [effective action].

## My WOOP for learning Python
**Wish**: 我要在未来的2个月时间里完成《笨办法学Python》里的所有编程练习。
**Outcome**: 这个目标是我学习编程的开端，
